world is for the Gentoo portage system to organize your world file
and to find installed packages or differences to @world (--depclean)

This project has several purposes:

1. It lets you save/restore your world file and compare with the backups.
2. It can output your installed packages.
3. It can output the packages which would be installed from your @world,
   and it can compare them with 3.

For instance, the following is similar to emerge --depclean:
emerge `world -2 test`

For more details, see the output of "world help".

For installation, copy world with executable permission in your path.
To obtain support for zsh completion, you can copy _world to a
directory of zsh's $fpath
There is also an ebuild in the mv overlay (which is available by layman).
